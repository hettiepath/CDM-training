PERSON table
|Column name|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|PERSON_ID|2|The PERSON_ID should be an integer, either directly from the source or generated as part of the build process.|
|GENDER_CONCEPT_ID|8507|The concept ID referring to male gender is 8507.|
|YEAR_OF_BIRTH|1974||
|MONTH_OF_BIRTH|8||
|DAY_OF_BIRTH|4||
|BIRTH_DATETIME|1974-08-04 00:00:00|When the time is not known midnight is used.|
|DEATH_DATETIME|*NULL*||
|RACE_CONCEPT_ID|8516|The concept ID referring to Black or African American is 8516.|
|ETHNICITY_CONCEPT_ ID|38003564|This is a US-typical notation to distinguish Hispanics from the rest. Outside the US this is not used. 38003564 refers to “Not hispanic”.|
|LOCATION_ID||His address is not known.|
|PROVIDER_ID||His primary care Provider is not known.|
|CARE_SITE||His primary Care Site is not known.|
|PERSON_SOURCE_ VALUE|2|Typically this would be his identifier in the source data, though often it is the same as the PERSON_ID.|
|GENDER_SOURCE_ VALUE|M|The gender value as it appears in the source is stored here.|
|GENDER_SOURCE_ CONCEPT_ID|1|If the gender value in the source was coded using a coding scheme supported by OHDSI that Concept would go here. For example, if his gender was “sex-M” in the source and it was stated to be in the PCORNet vocabulary concept 44814666 would go in this field.|
|RACE_SOURCE_ VALUE|African American|The race value as it appears in the source is stored here.|
|RACE_SOURCE_ CONCEPT_ID|1|Same principle as GENDER_CONCEPT_ID.|
|ETHNICITY_SOURCE_ VALUE|*NULL*|The ethnicity value as it appears in the source is stored here.|
|ETHNICITY_SOURCE_ CONCEPT_ID|1|Same principle as GENDER_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID.|


#### Exercise 4.2 
John enrolled in his current insurance on January 1st, 2015. The data from his insurance database were extracted on July 1st, 2019. Define an entry in the OBSERVATION_PERIOD table that encodes this information.

OBSERVATION_PERIOD table
|Column name|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|OBSERVATION_ PERIOD_ID|2|This is typically an autogenerated value creating a unique identifier for each record in the table.|
|PERSON_ID|2|This is a foreign key to John’s record in the PERSON table and links PERSON to OBSERVATION_PERIOD table.|
|OBSERVATION_PERIOD_ START_DATE|2015-01-01|This is the start date of her earliest encounter on record.|
|OBSERVATION_PERIOD_ END_DATE|2019-07-01|This is the end date of her latest encounter on record.|
|PERIOD_TYPE_ CONCEPT_ID|44814722|https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/44814722|

#### Exercise 4.3 
John was prescribed a 30-day supply of Ibuprofen 200 MG Oral tablets (NDC code: 76168009520) on May 1st, 2019. Define an entry in the DRUG_EXPOSURE table that encodes this information.

DRUG_EXPOSURE table
|Column name|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|DRUG_EXPOSURE_ID|1002|This is typically an autogenerated value creating a unique identifier for each record.|
|PERSON_ID|2|This is a foreign key to John’s record in the PERSON table and links PERSON to DRUG_EXPOSURE.|
|DRUG_CONCEPT_ID|1177480|Ibuprofen 200 MG Oral tablets. https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/19078461|
|DRUG_EXPOSURE_ START_DATE|2019-05-01|The start date of the exposure to the Drug.|
|DRUG_EXPOSURE_ START_DATETIME|2019-05-01 00:00:00|The start date and time of the drug exposure. Midnight is used as the time is not known.|
|DRUG_EXPOSURE_ END_DATE|2019-05-31|30-day supply. The end date of the Drug Exposure. Depending on different sources, it could be a known or an inferred date and denotes the last day at which the patient was still exposed to the drug. In this case this date is inferred since we know Lauren had a 30 days supply.|
|DRUG_EXPOSURE_ END_DATETIME|2019-05-31 00:00:00|The end date and time of the drug exposure. Similar rules apply as to DRUG_EXPOSURE_END_DATE. Midnight is used as time is unknown.|
|VERBATIM_END_DATE|NULL|If the source recorded an explicit actual end date. The inferred end date banks on the assumption that the full range of days supply was utilized by the patient.|
|DRUG_TYPE_ CONCEPT_ID|38000177|This column is intended to provide information about the provenance of the record, i.e. does it come from an insurance claim, prescription record, etc. For this example the concept 38000177 (“Prescription written”) is used.|
|STOP_REASON|NULL|The reason the administration of the Drug was stopped. Reasons include regimen completed, changed, removed, etc. This information is very rarely captured.|
|REFILLS|NULL|The number of automatic refills after the initial prescription that are part of the prescription system in many countries. The initial prescription is not counted, values start with NULL. In the case of Lauren’s acetaminophen she did not have any refills so the value is NULL.|

|DAYS_SUPPLY|30|The number of days of supply of the medication as prescribed.|
|SIG|NULL|The directions (“signetur”) on the Drug prescription as recorded in the original prescription or dispensing record (and printed on the container in the US drug prescription system). Signeturs are not yet standardized in the CDM, and provided verbatim.|

|VISIT_DETAIL_ID|NULL|A foreign key to the VISIT_DETAIL table during which the Drug was prescribed.|
|DRUG_SOURCE_ VALUE|76168009520|NDC code: 76168009520|
|DRUG_SOURCE_ CONCEPT_ID|583945|Ibuprofen 200 MG Oral tablets. https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/583945|
